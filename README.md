# USI-OS — Unified Smart Industry Operating System

USI-OS is a software-first, AI-driven Smart Industry Operating System designed to bring 
predictive maintenance, autonomous decision-making, and digital twin simulation to 
MSME-scale factories without requiring new hardware.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities
- Real-time predictive maintenance using time-series machine data
- Agent-based autonomous decision workflows for operations and maintenance
- Digital twin simulation of factory processes and machine behavior
- Supply-chain visibility with batch-level traceability
- Industrial KPI dashboards (uptime, downtime, throughput, quality, lead time)

## 🧠 Architecture Overview
USI-OS ingests continuous operational data, processes it through ML models and 
intelligent agents, and delivers actionable insights via dashboards and alerts.
Agents autonomously detect anomalies, recommend actions, and optimize operations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning & Time-Series Analytics
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Digital Twin Simulation
- Data Engineering Pipelines
- Dashboards & Visualization
- Blockchain-style Traceability (Conceptual)

## 🎯 Target Users
- MSME factory owners and operators
- Industrial operations teams
- Energy and manufacturing optimization use cases
- Smart manufacturing research and innovation teams

## 📊 Use Cases
- Predictive maintenance and failure prevention
- Production optimization and energy efficiency
- Quality monitoring and batch traceability
- Supply-chain visibility and risk detection

## 🔮 Vision
USI-OS aims to serve as a scalable foundation for intelligent, autonomous, and 
energy-efficient industrial ecosystems, bridging the gap between traditional MSMEs 
and Industry 4.0 capabilities.
